                User feedback

Feedback was collected from 3 users. 
the users were given the Website URL and a 3-minute introduction regarding the concept of the Website


Each user was given 30 minutes to go through the website and check for themselves how to work on it.

One of the users found a bug when adding a new ticket in the board page. 
The bug was if a user was adding a ticket without adding description the ticket would have the previous added ticket description, 
that bug was fixed so that a user must fill in Title and a description when adding a ticket otherwise it wouldnâ€™t be added. 


Beside the above-mentioned bug most feedback was regarding the views and the navigation around the site.

One user suggested to have the logo as home button as most people are used to press on 
the logo of a website to go back to the home page of a website. 

Another user wanted to see information about the project before adding it as a project to work on, 
so and the Bug-tracker team implemented the functionality so that after a user search for a project they can press 
on the git repository and get a pop up with additional information.

lastly all users suggested other info that they felt would be relevant to see in
 the home page and in the popup after searching for a git repository, the suggested information was added afterwards.
 
The requested information was languages used in the repository, issue existences and its count. 

before and after pictures are submited with the project submission.
